## Peaks and Playas
I created *Peaks and Playas,* a map detailing the diverse landforms and ecosystems of Nevada.
Created over the course of a semester long cartogarphy seminar, I tought myself how to produce hillshade's in Blender and expanded my knowledge of terrain mapping in Adobe Photoshop. 
In a collabrative setting, classmates provided feedback and critiques through the design process. 
The end result displays a much maligned state, often seen as solely the site of vice or nuclear waste, as it actually is: a place full diverse ecosystems and landforms.
